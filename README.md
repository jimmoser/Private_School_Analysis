# Private_School_Analysis
This is an analysis of the number of private schools in the United States between 2017 and 2019. The data is from data.gov and the St. Louis Fed websites.

This is an extra-credit project that I completed the end of my first term in the Georgia Tech Online Master's of Science in Data Analytics. The course was CSE6040: Computing for Analytics. It showcases some of my Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib skills.
